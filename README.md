# Buy Me A Coffee â˜•

A Solidity smart contract that allows users to buy coffee using Ether or supported ERC20 tokens. The contract leverages Chainlink Oracles to determine the required amount of Ether or ERC20 tokens for a given number of coffee units. The contract owner can update the supported ERC20 tokens and their respective price feeds. The contract also provides withdrawal functionality for the contract owner.
